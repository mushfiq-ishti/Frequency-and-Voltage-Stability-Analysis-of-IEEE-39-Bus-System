# Frequency-and-Voltage-Stability-Analysis-of-IEEE-39-Bus-System
Analysis of the IEEE 39-bus system for load flow, frequency response under generator outage, and voltage stability. Evaluated load shedding schemes, ranking buses by stability using FVSI, and studying the impact of load frequency relief on stability and shedding.
